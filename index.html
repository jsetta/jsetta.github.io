  <h1 id="what-is-an-isetta">What is an <em>Isetta</em>?</h1>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The economic devastation of World War II lead to the birth and brief popularity of the &ldquo;microcar&rdquo; phenomenon.
The idea was to combine the low cost (and low taxes) of a motorscooter with the safety and practiality of a car.
The results were some of the most distinctive (and amusing) &ldquo;car&rdquo; designs in history.</p>
<h2 id="rise">Rise</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most famous microcars ever were the <em>Isettas</em>, an iconic clan of egg-shaped microcars pioneered by Italian motor company <em>Iso</em> (hence the name) and later produced under license by several European car makers.
Perhaps the single most iconic feature of the <em>Isetta</em> was its single door: the entire front of the body opened and swung to the side!</p>
<p><img src="../img/front-door1.jpg" alt="Isetta Front Door"></p>
<p><em>In the picture above, John (far left, standing, facing the car) shows his <em>Isetta</em> and its distinctive front door to BJA German Club students.</em></p>
<p>The best-known <em>Isettas</em> were the variants produced by BMW: the original <em>Isetta</em> 250, the up-engined <em>Isetta</em> 300 (with <em>one whole extra</em> horsepower!), and the stretch-body <em>Isetta</em> 600 (seating <em>four</em>, with <em>two</em> whole doors).
BMW kept the basic <em>Iso</em> body style but reworked the drivetrain to use their own 4-stroke engine technology.</p>
<h2 id="fall">Fall</h2>
<p>As Europe&rsquo;s postwar economy recovered then boomed in the 1950s, the interest in microcars waned.
BMW became known for making <em>real</em> cars, especially luxury and performance models.
As the <em>Isetta</em> was neither, it quickly faded from the scene and became a historical curiosity.</p>
<h2 id="immigration">Immigration</h2>
<p>A modest number of BMW <em>Isettas</em> were imported to the US in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
In an age when Detroit was cranking out gleaming chrome cruisers the size of battleships, <em>Isettas</em> were little more than novelties.
At least one American luxury car dealer would <strong>give</strong> buyers of &ldquo;real&rdquo; cars a free <em>Isetta</em> as a bonus!</p>
<p>In Fenton, MI, one of these &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; <em>Isettas</em> was driven into disrepair and sold cheap to a cash-strapped teenager named John Jueckstock in 1964.
It wasn&rsquo;t much of a car, but it was his first; and he&rsquo;s managed to keep it running (off and on) for over half a century!</p>

  <h1 id="johns-isetta-story">John&rsquo;s <em>Isetta</em> Story</h1>
<h2 id="purchase">Purchase</h2>
<p>John Jueckstock found the <em>Isetta</em> in 1964 in his hometown of Fenton, Michigan.
He was a 17 year old high school junior.
The <em>Isetta</em> had been given away by a car dealership as a promotional bonus to buyers of large luxury cars.
Its first owner had driven it as a plaything until the brakes had given out, and now he was looking to unload it.</p>
<p>John somehow managed to scrape together $100 and bought the <em>Isetta</em>, probably never thinking that he would still be driving his first car over half a century later.</p>
<p>Driving the <em>Isetta</em> without working brakes was nerve-wracking but just barely possible.
To stop, John would downshift aggressively to engine-brake, tug on the emergency brake (which still worked, a little) to get it down to a slow roll, and finally slip the transmission into reverse and gingerly pop the clutch to bring the car to a lurching halt at the last second.
<em>(Unsurprisingly, the transmission has been through multiple overhauls since.)</em></p>
<h2 id="the-cars-on-fire">&ldquo;The Car&rsquo;s on Fire!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The night after John purchased the <em>Isetta</em>, he set off &ldquo;cruising&rdquo; to show it off to his two best friends.
They were duly impressed and set off with John to cruise the neighborhood like the cool kids.
Sometime during the &ldquo;cruising&rdquo;, one of the curious boys locked the only door.</p>
<p>None of them were aware, at that moment, of a peculiar design quirk of the BMW <em>Isetta</em> and its unfortunate implications for their evening cruise.
An <em>Isetta</em>&rsquo;s battery is located under the bench seat.
It is supposed to have an insulating cover protecting the battery terminals from the wire bracing and coil springs of the seat above.
Alas, John&rsquo;s new <em>Isetta</em> did not, in fact, possess such a cover.
With the weight of three rambunctious high school boys bouncing on the seat, its wire bracing soon created a short between the battery&rsquo;s terminals, resulting in incandescent seat springs and smoldering seat stuffing as the seat gradually caught fire.</p>
<p>While they waited at a stop light, the boys were suddenly enveloped in acrid white smoke.
Panic ensued.
While John&rsquo;s friends thrashed around to get out of the car, John couldn&rsquo;t reach past them to unlock the door, compounding the panic.
When the door was finally unlocked and the car&rsquo;s occupants released, one of John&rsquo;s friends danced around the car shrieking &ldquo;the car&rsquo;s on fire, the car&rsquo;s on fire!&rdquo; at the top of his lungs to all passers-by.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, John was able to pull the seat out of the car and stop the fire before it did any permanent damage, but this wasn&rsquo;t the last time the seat would catch fire.
The next seat fire disrupted an otherwise promising date and resulted in an evening spent sitting on an <em>Isetta</em> bench seat extracted from the car and placed against a tree trunk while the smoking <em>Isetta</em> cooled down enough to drive home.</p>
<p><strong>For the record, John&rsquo;s <em>Isetta</em> now features a very effective battery cover, and spontaneous seat fires are a thing of the past.</strong></p>
<h2 id="highschool-hijinks">Highschool Hijinks</h2>
<p>Q: How many highschool football players can you fit into an <em>Isetta</em> for a run to the local &ldquo;Dog &rsquo;n&rsquo; Suds&rdquo; drivethrough?</p>
<p>A: <strong>Five (5)</strong>; John behind the wheel, two buddies squeezed into the bench seat beside him, and two more buddies sitting on their laps (with their heads out the open sun roof).</p>
<p>Q: How many highschool football players does it take to carry an <em>Isetta</em> up the front steps of the Fenton public high school?</p>
<p>A: <strong>Unknown</strong>, but the car was found there on at least one occasion, nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="out-in-the-cold">Out in the Cold</h2>
<p>After high school, John attended Appalachian Bible College, where he met and married a girl named Judy.
John left the <em>Isetta</em> in the care of a friend in West Virginia while he and his new bride moved to Minnesota for John&rsquo;s continuing education.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometime later, the &ldquo;friend&rdquo; ran out of room in his garage and relocated the <em>Isetta</em> to . . . the woods on a hillside behind his house.  (He did throw a tarp over it, so it had that going for it.)</p>
<p>By the time John had finished his BA (Bethel College) and MM (University of Northern Colorado), and returned to claim the <em>Isetta</em>, it was in pretty sorry shape!</p>
<h2 id="the-first-rebuild">The First Rebuild</h2>
<p>With his &ldquo;poor student&rdquo; days behind him and his &ldquo;less poor college music teacher&rdquo; days begun in Birmingham, Alabama, John set about restoring the <em>Isetta</em> to working order in the late 1970s.</p>
<p><img src="img/first-rebuild.jpg" alt="John and a friend overhaul the Isetta in the late 1970s in Birmingham, AL."></p>
<p><em>In the above photo you can see John (right) and a friend (left) working on the <em>Isetta</em>&rsquo;s body, which has been hoisted off of the chassis (not pictured).
You can also see the original &ldquo;Feather White&rdquo; factory color scheme.</em></p>
<p>The world of <em>Isetta</em> fans was tiny and obscure back the in the pre-Web days of the 1970s, but somehow John found an <em>Isetta</em> owners&rsquo; club and through them a specialist in California who rebuilt <em>Isetta</em> engines.</p>
<p><img src="img/engine-overhaul1.jpg" alt="First Isetta engine rebuild"></p>
<p>John shipped the partially disassembled <em>Isetta</em> engine off to California and was relieved to receive a return shipment containing the fully rebuilt and reassembled engine, which ran without issue when remounted in the car.
The <em>Isetta</em> was running again!</p>
<h2 id="daily-driver">Daily Driver</h2>
<p>The next stop in John and Judy&rsquo;s nomadic life was Ft. Worth, Texas, where John embarked on a five year DMA <em>(Doctor of Musical Arts)</em> degree program at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.
Judy worked full time to put hubby through, and John worked whatever jobs or side gigs he could find during the summers.
He often used the <em>Isetta</em> as a daily driver for his summer gigs, even if it meant braving the traffic on the infamous &ldquo;Mix Master&rdquo; in downtown Dallas/Ft. Worth.</p>
<p>It was at this point that John painted the heretofore white <em>Isetta</em> the brightest yellow he could find.
Every little bit of visibility helps when you are looking out the window at the hubcaps of big rigs that could just as easily drive over you as around you!</p>
<p><img src="img/in-texas.jpg" alt="In Texas"></p>
<p><em>In the above picture from John and Judy&rsquo;s Texas days, you can spot both the Isetta nestled in is custom-made carport and the 1975 Volvo 244 that John&rsquo;s son Jordan still drives to work (and uses to tow the Isetta to events) today!</em></p>
<p>On at least a few occasions, John used the <em>Isetta</em> to transport his equipment to house painting gigs.
His ladders had to protrude out the sun roof, but that just helped make the <em>Isetta</em> more visible, anyway.</p>
<h2 id="back-into-storage">Back Into Storage</h2>
<p>Time stops for no microcar, and the <em>Isetta</em> faced another time in storage after John and Judy felt the call of God to the mission field in Italy starting in 1988.
As they prepared to leave the US in 1991, they stored the <em>Isetta</em> (and the Volvo, and other household goods they expected to return for eventually) in a garage built on the property of John&rsquo;s big brother George.</p>
<p><img src="img/front-door2.jpg" alt="Little Jordan and the Isetta"></p>
<p><em>In the above photo, five-year-old Jordan Jueckstock plays in the Isetta as it is positioned in long-term storage before the move to Italy in 1991.</em></p>
<p>George relocated in 1997, necessitating a trip back to the states to move all the stored goods to a new garage at George&rsquo;s new place.
Finally, after John and Judy returned to the States for good in 2005, the <em>Isetta</em> was brought out of storage in 2008.</p>
<p>Extensive work was required to get the <em>Isetta</em> running again, and it was starting to require significant cosmetic work, too.
John&rsquo;s son Jordan, now a senior at Bob Jones University, got to help some this time.</p>
<p><img src="img/refurb2009a.jpg" alt="Getting it back together."></p>
<p><img src="img/refurb2009b.jpg" alt="Getting it back together, cont&rsquo;d."></p>
<h2 id="wedding-bells">Wedding Bells</h2>
<p>When time came for Jordan to wed the lovely Jessica in 2010, the Isetta was called on to perform wedding getaway duty!</p>
<p><img src="img/just-married.jpg" alt="Just married!"></p>
<p><img src="img/isetta-kiss.jpg" alt="One kiss for the road"></p>
<p>Alas, time had not been kind to the ancient 300cc engine, and the lifters seized up weeks before the wedding, incapacitating the Isetta.
Nothing but a serious overhaul would restore that stuttering bantam roar to life, and the prospects of a romantic getaway in a garish yellow motorized egg faded.</p>
<p><img src="img/isetta-bandaid.jpg" alt="Alas, the engine was kaput that day&hellip;"></p>
<p>John&rsquo;s creativity would not, however, be stymied.
With help from his friends and cooworkers at BJU Press Digital&rsquo;s prop department, John arranged for a magnetic &ldquo;band-aid&rdquo; to adorn the engine hatch of the silenced Isetta.</p>
<p><img src="img/push-crew.jpg" alt="Groomsmen to the rescue!"></p>
<p>The groomsmen and ushers provided the horsepower, and the couple was pushed away into wedded bliss.
<em>(The immediate availability of another, actually working, automobile to handle subsequent honeymoon travel significantly helped maintain said bliss.)</em></p>
<h2 id="crowd-pleaser">Crowd Pleaser</h2>
<p>But band-aid solutions are not forever.
The <em>Isetta</em>&rsquo;s engine was overhauled once more and the whole vehicle restored to pristine operating condition.</p>
<p><img src="img/car-show1.jpg" alt="At the car show&hellip;"></p>
<p>In 2011, John took the <em>Isetta</em> to the vintage car show held at the BMW Zentrum Museum in Greer, SC.
The plucky little microcar may have looked a little out of place next to rare classics and vintage supercars, but someone forgot to tell the spectators, who flocked to gawk at its diminuative absurdity.</p>
<p><img src="img/car-show2.jpg" alt="Crowd pleaser!"></p>
<p>It even brought home first prize in the &ldquo;Crowd Pleaser&rdquo; category!</p>
