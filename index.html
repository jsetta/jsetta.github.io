  <h1 id="what-is-an-isetta">What is an <em>Isetta</em>?</h1>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The economic devastation of World War II lead to the birth and brief popularity of the &ldquo;microcar&rdquo; phenomenon.
The idea was to combine the low cost (and low taxes) of a motorscooter with the safety and practiality of a car.
The results were some of the most distinctive (and amusing) &ldquo;car&rdquo; designs in history.</p>
<h2 id="rise">Rise</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most famous microcars ever were the <em>Isettas</em>, an iconic clan of egg-shaped microcars pioneered by Italian motor company <em>Iso</em> (hence the name) and later produced under license by several European car makers.
Perhaps the single most iconic feature of the <em>Isetta</em> was its single door: the entire front of the body opened and swung to the side!</p>
<p>The best-known <em>Isettas</em> were the variants produced by BMW: the original <em>Isetta</em> 250, the up-engined <em>Isetta</em> 300 (with <em>one whole extra</em> horsepower!), and the stretch-body <em>Isetta</em> 600 (seating <em>four</em>, with <em>two</em> whole doors).
BMW kept the basic <em>Iso</em> body style but reworked the drivetrain to use their own 4-stroke engine technology.</p>
<h2 id="fall">Fall</h2>
<p>As Europe&rsquo;s postwar economy recovered then boomed in the 1950s, the interest in microcars waned.
BMW became known for making <em>real</em> cars, especially luxury and performance models.
As the <em>Isetta</em> was neither, it quickly faded from the scene and became a historical curiosity.</p>
<h2 id="immigration">Immigration</h2>
<p>A modest number of BMW <em>Isettas</em> were imported to the US in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
In an age when Detroit was cranking out gleaming chrome cruisers the size of battleships, <em>Isettas</em> were little more than novelties.
At least one American luxury car dealer would <strong>give</strong> buyers of &ldquo;real&rdquo; cars a free <em>Isetta</em> as a bonus!</p>
<p>In Fenton, MI, one of these &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; <em>Isettas</em> was driven into disrepair and sold cheap to a cash-strapped teenager named John Jueckstock in 1964.
It wasn&rsquo;t much of a car, but it was his first; and he&rsquo;s managed to keep it running (off and on) for almost half a century!</p>
<h2 id="specifications-1957-bmw-isetta-300">Specifications (1957 BMW <em>Isetta</em> 300)</h2>
<h3 id="engine">Engine</h3>
<p>300cc, 4-stroke, 1-cylinder.
Adapted from a 250cc BMW motorcycle engine.
<em>(And &ldquo;detuned&rdquo; to avoid destroying the fragile transmission&hellip;)</em></p>
<h3 id="transmission">Transmission</h3>
<p>4-speed (plus reverse), partially synchronized manual.</p>
<h3 id="brakes">Brakes</h3>
<p>Three (3) unboosted hydraulic drum brakes. <em>(There is only one rear brake, as the rear axle is solid.)</em></p>
<h3 id="door--windows">Door &amp; Windows</h3>
<p>One (1) door <em>(the entire front of the car)</em>.
Two (2) sliding side windows, plus 1 canvas sunroof <em>(which doubles as emergency escape)</em>.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>0-60 time: ðŸ¤£</p>
<p>The <em>Isetta</em>&rsquo;s theoretical max speed is <strong>53mph</strong> <em>(reachable in . . . maybe 30 seconds?)</em></p>
<p>Fuel efficiency is good, about <strong>60mpg</strong> (US).</p>

<h2 id="purchase">Purchase</h2>
<p>How John found and purchased the <em>Isetta</em> for $100 in 1964.</p>
<h2 id="the-cars-on-fire">&ldquo;The Car&rsquo;s on Fire!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The night John showed off his new car to two friends, and nearly burned it (and themselves) to a crisp!</p>
<h2 id="highschool-hijinks">Highschool Hijinks</h2>
<p>How many highschool football players can you fit into an <em>Isetta</em> for a run to the &ldquo;Dog &rsquo;n&rsquo; Suds&rdquo; drivethrough?</p>
<p>How many highschool football players does it take to carry an <em>Isetta</em> up the front steps of the Fenton public high school?</p>
<h2 id="out-in-the-cold">Out in the Cold</h2>
<p>John left home, went to Bible college, got married, and left the <em>Isetta</em> in the care of a friend in West Virginia while he and his new bride moved to Minnesota for John&rsquo;s continuing education.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometime later, the &ldquo;friend&rdquo; ran out of room in his garage and relocated the <em>Isetta</em> to . . . the woods on a hillside behind his house.  (He did throw a tarp over it, so it had that going for it.)</p>
<p>By the time John had finished his BA (Bethel College) and MM (University of Northern Colorado), and returned to claim the <em>Isetta</em>, it was in pretty sorry shape!</p>
<h2 id="the-first-rebuild">The First Rebuild</h2>
<p>With his &ldquo;poor student&rdquo; days behind him and his &ldquo;less poor college music teacher&rdquo; days begun in Birmingham, Alabama, John set about restoring the <em>Isetta</em> to working order in the late 1970s.</p>
<p><img src="../img/first-rebuild.jpg" alt="John and a friend overhaul the Isetta in the late 1970s in Birmingham, AL."></p>
<p>In the above photo you can see John (right) and a friend (left) working on the <em>Isetta</em>&rsquo;s body, which has been hoisted off of the chassis (not pictured).
You can also see the original &ldquo;Feather White&rdquo; factory color scheme.</p>
